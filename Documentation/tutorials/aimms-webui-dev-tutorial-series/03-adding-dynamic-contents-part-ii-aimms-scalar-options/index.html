		<h1 class="wp-title">AIMMS WebUI Dev Tutorial</h1>
		<h2 class="wp-title" id="03-adding-dynamic-contents-part-ii-aimms-scalar-options">03 - Adding dynamic contents, part II: Simple data from AIMMS</h2>
		<p> In this tutorial you will learn how to update the widget that we created in
			<a href="../01-writing-your-first-custom-widget/index.html">tutorial-01</a> and extended with dynamic contents in 
			<a href="../02-adding-dynamic-contents-part-i-options/index.html">tutorial-02</a> such that you can change 
			its contents from within an AIMMS model. We will go into a little more details on the
			<em>AWF Option Mechanism</em> that was previously introduced. Like in the previous tutorials, we will
			leave out much of the technical details and underlying design and only explain the essential things
			in order to get you up-and-running as soon as possible. But this tutorial will be longer and will go
			into more details than the previous tutorials.
		<h3>Before we begin - Prerequisites</h3>
		<p>To make the most out of this tutorial, it is important that you meet a couple of prerequisites.
		<p>First of all, we are going to assume that you already familiarized yourself a bit with the AIMMS WebUI.
			Both with the end-usage and the app-development. That you have a recent AIMMS and that you have it
			running in your set-up.
		<p>Since this is a (software) development tutorial, we are also assuming that you have experience in writing
			software in a generic programming language, and, that you have a basic knowledge on HTML5 technologies
			(HTML5 DOM, CSS, Javascript, and the likes). It is also beneficial, however not required, if you are
			familiar with <a href="http://jquery.org">jQuery</a> and, to lesser extent,
			<a href="http://jquery-ui.org">jQuery UI</a>, as AIMMS WebUI is built on top of these technologies.
		<p> Finally, since this tutorial builds on the previous tutorial, we expect that you have done that tutorial
			first. If you have not done so yet, here is a link to <a href="../02-adding-dynamic-contents-part-i-options/index.html">tutorial-02</a>.
		<h3>Dynamic contents in AWF - revisited</h3>
		<p> Previously, it was stated that there are two ways of having dynamic contents in an AWF widget. The easiest
			method being through the use of options and the other method is to use data from the AIMMS model.
			The distinction between option or not, however, was made for the sake of simplicity. In reality, both methods
			use the AWF Option Mechanism, though in a slightly different way. To understand the subtle differences, it is
			important to understand how an option, in AWF, gets a value, and, what actually that value in AWF encompasses.
		<p> Model¹ data is bound to an AWF option through a process called <em>data binding</em>.
		<p> <q><em>Data binding</em> is the process that establishes a connection between the application UI (User Interface)
			and business logic. If the settings and notifications are correctly set, the data reflects changes when made.
			It can also mean that when the UI is changed, the underlying data will reflect that change.²</q>
		<p> Currently in AWF, an option can be bound to two sources of data:
		<ol>
			<li>a (local) <em>literal</em> value, and
			<li>a (remote) <em>aimms</em> value.
		</ol>
		How to bind data to an option will be explained in the next section.
		<p> ¹ <small>Here we, as in tutorial-01, mean model in a broad and abstract sense, but you can read it as the model and/or
					 its model data in AIMMS.</small><br/>
			² <small>Please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Data_binding&oldid=650718924">WikipediA</a>
					 for more information.</small>
		<h3>The basic components of an option (repeat)</h3>
		<p> Recall from <a href="../02-adding-dynamic-contents-part-i-options/index.html">tutorial-02</a> that an option in AWF consists of:
		<ol>
			<li>a <em>name</em>,
			<li>a <em>type</em>, and
			<li>a <em>value</em>.
		</ol>
		<h3>Three states of an option value</h3>
		<p> In addition to this, an option value can have three different states:
		<ol>
			<li><em>specified</em>,
			<li><em>parsed</em>, and
			<li><em>resolved</em>.
		</ol>
		<p> The <em>specified</em> value of an option is the option value in its serialized form. It is either <tt>null</tt>¹, or,
			a (JSON/JavaScript) string literal. It has the following syntax:
		<blockquote>
			<tt>&lt;data-provider&gt;<b>:</b>&lt;JSON&gt;</tt><br/><br/>
			<small>Where:</small>
			<ul>
				<li><tt>data-provider</tt> <small>is the name of the provider for the data. Currently in AWF there are two data-providers
					available: <em>literal</em>² and <em>aimms</em></small>.
				<li><tt>JSON</tt> <small>is the object, serialized as JSON, that, together with the option <em>type</em>, is used by
					AWF data-binding to resolve the final value</small>.
			</ul>
			<small>Notes:</small>
			<ul>
				<li><small>Examples of specified values:</small>
				<ul>
					<li><small><tt>literal:123</tt></small>
					<li><small><tt>literal:"Hello AIMMS!"</tt></small>
					<li><small><tt>aimms:{"contents": ["MyIdentifierA", "MyIdentifierB"]}</tt></small>
				</ul>
				<li><small>In AWF databinding, small simple type-coercion³ is performed when possible. This means that a number will
						be resolved to a string if the option <em>type</em> is a string, even when the input is a numerical value, and,
						vice versa (restrictions apply).</small></li>
				<li><small>For the literal data-provider, the resolved value typically is the same as the specified value.</small>
			</ul>
		</blockquote>
		<p> The <em>parsed</em> value of an option is an intermediate value state between <em>specified</em> and <em>resolved</em> and is used
			to aid in the transition between the two.
		<p> The <em>resolved</em> value of an option is the actual option value which a widget typically uses to update its
			associated DOM element.
		<p> ¹ <small>Recall from tutorial-02 that <tt>null</tt> denotes that the widget should use a default value that is
					 intrinsic to the specific widget.</small><br/>
			² <small>In tutorial-02 the literal data-provider was used.</small><br/>
			³ <small>The term <em>type coercion</em> is typically used to denote an automatic or implicit form of type casting (see
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Type_conversion&oldid=652722792">WikipediA</a>).</small><br/>
		<h3>Option editors - revisited</h3>
		<p> Recall from <a href="../02-adding-dynamic-contents-part-i-options/index.html">tutorial-02</a> that an option editor
			provides a means to change the value of an option from the UI. To put this more precise, an option editor typically
			uses the <em>resolved value</em> to draw itself (i.e. its DOM tree), and, when a value is changed by the user using that
			option editor, the option editor subsequently uses the <em>parsed value</em> to update the <em>specified value</em> of
			the option¹. AWF data-binding then picks up the change, potentially causing a new value to resolve and -hence- the
			widget to be updated.
		<p> ¹ <small>We will go into these details later, when we show how to write your own option editor in a future tutorial.</small>

		<h3>Binding AIMMS data to our widget's option</h3>
		<p>	Now that we know a little more about the AWF Option Mechanism and its underlying data-binding mechanism, we can update
			our widget such that it gets its value from AIMMS. But first let's have a quick look at the current state of our widget
			and see the theory from the previous sections in action.
		<p> We start by opening the option dialog again:

		<p><picture>
			<img src="../assets/img/simple-option-editor-of-new-literal-option.png">
			<div><strong>figure 1</strong></div>
		</picture>

		<p> Now click on the tool icon <awf-icon>&#xe1d9;</awf-icon>. This will show the <em>advanced option editor</em> (figure 2).
			This option editor acts as a fall-back option editor. You can use it to directly manipulate the <em>specified value</em>
			of an option, even when a normal option editor fails.

		<p><picture>
			<img src="../assets/img/advanced-option-editor-of-new-literal-option.png">
			<div><strong>figure 2</strong></div>
		</picture>

		<p> Please observe the specified value for the <em>contents</em> option. If we recall from the theoretical section that
			the specified value of an option has the form: <tt>&lt;data-provider&gt;<b>:</b>&lt;JSON&gt;</tt>, we can see that
			the current version of our widget is using the <em>literal</em> data provider:

		<table>
			<thead><th><tt>data-provider</tt></th><th><tt>JSON</th></thead>
			<tbody><td><tt>literal</tt></td><td><tt>"This is updated realtime"</tt></td></tbody>
		</table>

		<p> Now let's see how easy it is to hook up an identifier from the AIMMS model to our widget. For that, we switch to
			the <em>AIMMS</em> data provider and tell it to resolve the value to that of the <tt>TotalTransportCost</tt> variable from
			the model:

		<table>
			<thead><th><tt>data-provider</tt></th><th><tt>JSON</th></thead>
			<tbody><td><tt>aimms</tt></td><td><tt>{"contents":["TotalTransportCost"]}</tt></td></tbody>
		</table>

		<p> In other words, change the specified value of the contents option using the advanced option editor to:
			<tt>aimms<b>:</b>{"contents":["TotalTransportCost"]}</tt>, like so¹ (do not press enter yet):

		<p><picture>
			<img src="../assets/img/advanced-option-editor-with-aimms-option.png">
			<div><strong>figure 3</strong></div>
		</picture>

		<p>¹ <small>Please note that the specified value here gets truncated due to limited space in the optiondialog</small>

		<p> Then, when you press enter, the contents of the widget updates:

		<p><picture>
			<img src="../assets/img/advanced-option-editor-with-aimms-option-and-resolved.png">
			<div><strong>figure 4</strong></div>
		</picture>

		<p> <tt>0,00</tt>! That may not seem much, but this value is coming from AIMMS! (You can check it if you wish.) And,
			because we specified the option type to be a <tt>string</tt> while the underlying data in the model is a numerical
			value, AWF even coerced the type for us to a nicely formatted string!
		<p> If you're not convinced yet, let's let AIMMS update the model. For this, we add a button to our page. Click the
			pencil icon in the top toolbar <awf-icon>&#xe00d;</awf-icon> and click the plus icon <awf-icon>&#xe376;</awf-icon>
			on the side bar that opens. Fill in the fields of the widget wizard that pops up like so:

		<p><picture>
			<img src="../assets/img/adding-optimize-button.png">
			<div><strong>figure 5</strong></div>
		</picture>

		<p> By default the title of the button is the same as the name of the procedure, but let's use a more inspiring name:

		<p><picture>
			<img src="../assets/img/change-title-of-button-to-optimize.png">
			<div><strong>figure 6</strong></div>
		</picture>

		<p> After adding and configuring our new button, the page should look like this:

		<p><picture>
			<img src="../assets/img/before-pressing-optimize.png">
			<div><strong>figure 7</strong></div>
		</picture>

		<p> Now, when we press the new <em>Optimize!</em> button, we instruct AIMMS to calculate the optimal solution and update
			the <em>TotalTransportCost</em> variable that we show in our widget. Let's see what happens...

		<p><picture>
			<img src="../assets/img/after-pressing-optimize.png">
			<div><strong>figure 8</strong></div>
		</picture>
		
		<p> Et voilà! After pressing the button, our widget updates as expected. And there you have it, your first widget with
			data from AIMMS!

		<h3>Recap</h3>
		<p> This was quite a big tutorial. Let's do a small recap of what we've learnt today. AWF allows you to <em>bind</em> data
			to your widget through the use of <em>options</em>. Two <em>data-providers</em> are readily available in AWF, one for
			<em>literal</em> values and one for values coming from <em>aimms</em>.
		<p> An option value has three states (or forms), <em>specified</em>, <em>parsed</em> and <em>resolved</em>. In this tutorial,
			we did not have to change any code of our widget, we only changed the <em>specified</em> value of our option and changed
			the data-provider from <em>literal</em> to <em>aimms</em>.
		<p> Next time, we will continue on this path and show you how to retrieve <em>multi-dimensional</em> data from AIMMS.
		
<!--And there you have it,
		<p> Inside the factory.js we specify the <em>contents</em> option which is of type <tt>string</tt>. We do this inside the
			<tt>onInitializeOptionTypes</tt>.

<pre><code class="js">
// factory.js
AWF.Bus.subscribe({
	onCollectTypes: function(collectedTypes, contextElQ) {
		if (!contextElQ || contextElQ.awf.tags("placeable")) {
			collectedTypes.push("my-widget");
		}
	},
	onDecorateElement: function(elQ, type) {
		if (type === "my-widget") {
			elQ.aimms_my_widget();
		}
	},
	onInitializeOptionTypes: function(elQ, type) {
		if (type === "my-widget") {
			elQ.awf.optionTypes("contents", AWF.OptionUtil.createOptionType("string"));
		}
	},
});
</code></pre>

		<h3>Reacting to option changes</h3>
		<p>In the widget we need to use the <tt>onResolvedOptionChanged</tt> function which is automatically invoked by AWF
			whenever an option value of the widget changes.
			Because we specified the <em>contents</em> option in the factory we are now able to listen for changes and
			react accordingly. In our case we update the text in the widget.

<pre><code class="js">// jquery.aimms.my-widget.js
jQuery.widget('ui.aimms_my_widget', AWF.Widget.create({
	_create: function() {
		var widget = this;
		widget.contentElQ = $('&lt;div&gt;Hello AIMMS!&lt;/div&gt;');

		widget.element
				.find('.awf-dock.center')
				.append(widget.contentElQ);
	},
	onResolvedOptionChanged: function(optionName, optionValue) {
		var widget = this;

		if (optionName === "contents") {
			if (optionValue) {
				widget.contentElQ.text(optionValue);
			} else {
				widget.contentElQ.text("Empty contents!");
			}
		}
	},
}));
</code></pre>

		<h3>Changing the value</h3>
		<p> After reloading the browser-tab, if we now open the widget's option dialog and navigate to the miscellaneous
			option editor (for historical reasons the icon is still denoted by a <tt>T</tt>), we will see that a new
			option editor has become available for the <em>contents</em> option. By typing inside the contents
			option's textfield, we can see that our widgets content is updated! (See figure 2)

		<p><picture>
			<img src="../assets/img/tut02-screenshot-2.png">
			<div><strong>figure 2</strong></div>
		</picture>

		<p>And there you have it, your first steps into the world of dynamic widgets in AWF using options. Next tutorial
			we will show you how to have dynamic widgets in AWF using data that comes from an AIMMS model.
