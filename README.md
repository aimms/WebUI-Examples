The WebUI-Examples github repository
====================================

Please find here a collection of examples for our ‘WebUI’ graphical user interface builder. Purpose of these examples is to help you speed up your learning and app development.

Although we aim to provide high quality examples and we are always keen to hear your feedback, please note that we
provide these examples ‘as-is’. They might not work under all circumstances and they have not been tested with the same
rigour with which we test our products. Also, we do not test these examples against every new AIMMS version that we
release. These examples fall outside our regular product support and associated SLA.
